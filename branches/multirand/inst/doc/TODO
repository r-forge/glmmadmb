Wish/to-do list

 * import this list to r-forge tracker

 * (BMB) provide package from www.math.mcmaster.ca for times when R-forge build is absent or out of date (source package only should be OK, since there is no compilable code in the package).  Set up a mirror or alternate repository 

 * allow alternative parameterization (i.e. var=mu(1+mu/k) of NB)?

 * add some sort of progress bar or "working ..." message in the absence of voluminous messages?  progress bar is difficult since ADMB doesn't know how long it will take

 * add warning about Wald tests to summary() man page

 * fix summary [alpha and standard error are missing

 * add MCMC option

 * add options for residuals

 * (BMB,medium): switch to using R2ADMB as interface layer?? Compare R2ADMB and glmmADMB interface code, take the best of both ...

 * alternative distributions: binomial models with size>1, implement Gamma, multinomial, ... , models
 * alternative links: cloglog, identity, probit for other cases, log ...
 * alternative RE distributions?
 * add more examples, tests, vignettes ...

 * predict() method (with newdata], simulate() methods) (confidence intervals, RE specifications?)

 * "R-side" random structure
