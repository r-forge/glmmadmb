Wish/to-do list

SHORT-TERM/EASY

* import this list to r-forge tracker
* (BMB) provide package from www.math.mcmaster.ca for times when R-forge build is absent or out of date (source package only should be OK, since there is no compilable code in the package).  Set up a mirror or alternate repository 
* allow alternative parameterization (i.e. var=mu(1+mu/k) of NB)?
* add some sort of progress bar or "working ..." message in the absence of voluminous messages?  progress bar is difficult since ADMB doesn't know how long it will take
* add warning about Wald tests to summary() man page
* fix summary [alpha and standard error of alpha are missing]
* add MCMC option
* add options for residuals
* switch to using R2ADMB as interface layer?? Compare R2ADMB and glmmADMB interface code, take the best of both ...
* alternative distributions: implement Gamma, multinomial, ... , models
* alternative links: cloglog, identity, probit for other cases, log ... (test!)
* alternative RE distributions?
* add more examples, tests, vignettes ... esp. simple/quick tests of new links etc.
* update epil2?  draw from MASS instead?
* predict() method (with newdata], simulate() methods) (confidence intervals, RE specifications?)
* make VarCorr() method work with lme4
* "R-side" random structure
