Wish/to-do list for glmmADMB

 * (BMB,easy) provide compiled windows, macos binaries from www.math.mcmaster.ca in the absence of R-forge binaries?
 * (BMB) turn off "welcome to glmmADMB" banner (done)
 * allow alternative parameterization of NB?
 * (BMB,easy,*done*): get glmmADMB to save most output from ADMB unless a
verbose flag is set to TRUE (I think this stuff scares users)
   ?? necessary to add some sort of progress bar or "working ..." message
    in the absence of voluminous messages?
 * (BMB, easy): implement a summary method that produces a coefficient
table in the 'standard' R format (coefficient, estimate, Z/t statistic
...) the big philosophical question would be whether to include a
two-tailed p value or not
 * (BMB, ?): add options for Pearson residuals?
 * (BMB, medium): implement a vcov() accessor method.  This would
require reading in an additional bit of information from the ADMB output.
 * (BMB,medium): switch to using R2ADMB as interface layer?? Compare R2ADMB and glmmADMB interface code, take the best of both ...
 * (BMB,?): implement binomial models with size>1 (i.e., non-Bernoulli
models)
 * (BMB, ?): add more examples, tests, vignettes ...
 * (BMB, easy): save fitted models in inst/ so they can be used easily
   in examples without doing the fits each time
 * (BMB, ???): add predict() method that allows newdata to be specified
 * (BMB, ????): allow more flexible random effects specifications, etc.
